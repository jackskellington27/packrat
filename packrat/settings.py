# This is a place holder that will get replaced during package install with a 
# symlink to /etc/packrat/master.conf
#
# for development work, replace this file with a symlink to your master.conf file
# which should be a derived from master.conf.sample.  In theory master.conf.sample
# should not have to be adjusted to much to fit your development environment
#
# this file is in the .gitignore to help your local symlink from getting commited
