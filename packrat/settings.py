#  settings.py
#
# This is a place holder that will get replaced during package install with a 
# symlink to /etc/packrat/master.conf.  Any Content in this file is lost when the
# package is installed.
#
# for development work, replace this file with a symlink to your master.conf file
# which should be a derived from master.conf.sample.  In theory master.conf.sample
# should not have to be adjusted to much to fit your development environment
#
# if you do change the file (ie create a symlink from it) run:
#
# git update-index --assume-unchanged packrat/settings.py
#
# to keep git from sending up stream your changes.
# if you really do want to change this file, run:
#
# git update-index --no-assume-unchanged packrat/settings.py
#
# and then git will track changes to this file again
#
